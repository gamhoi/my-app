这里的图片链接比如 /tempered-glass-architecture.png，应该放在哪个文件夹？

- 放在项目根目录的 `public/` 文件夹。以 `/` 开头的路径会从 `public/` 作为站点根目录提供静态文件。

示例：
- 把文件放到 `~/Downloads/git/julie/my-app/public/tempered-glass-architecture.png`，代码里的 `"/tempered-glass-architecture.png"` 可直接访问。
- 若想分目录：放到 `public/images/tempered-glass-architecture.png`，则把代码改成 `"/images/tempered-glass-architecture.png"`。

补充：
- 你现在这种字符串路径写法必须用 `public/`。如果图片放在别处，需要改为静态导入方式（如 `import img from "@/public/tempered-glass-architecture.png"` 然后 `src={img}`）。


- 说明了以 `/` 开头的图片应放 `public/`，并给出绝对路径与可选子目录写法。
